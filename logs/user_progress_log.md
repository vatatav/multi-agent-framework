**Topic:** Formalizing the Multi-Agent Framework Project
**Insights & Learnings:**
* This project has been successfully separated into its own entity to allow for focused, independent development.
* The architectural decision to distinguish between runtime files (ignored by Git) and development files (tracked in `src/`) is a major step forward in creating a professional, maintainable project.
* Standardizing utility scripts like the manifest generator from the beginning will ensure consistency in future handover cycles.
