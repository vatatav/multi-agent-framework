**ItemID:** MAF-S01-ADL-20250622-001-S0015
**Date:** 2025.06.22
**Phase:** Project Initialization & Structuring
**LLM Interactions - Actions:**
* Project created as a result of the "Project Mitosis" from the parent `roo_code_LLM_universe` project.
* Initial file structure was refined to separate runtime config (e.g., `.roomodes`, `.agent_workflows`) from version-controlled source (`src/`) and documentation (`docs/`).
* A foundational `README.md` was drafted and created.
* A project-specific `.gitignore` was defined and created.
* Standardized `generate_project_manifest.ps1` and `run_manifest_generator.bat` scripts were added to the project root for LLM handover procedures.
**User Insights Recorded:** User identified the need to separate runtime configuration from development source files, leading to a much cleaner and more robust project architecture.
