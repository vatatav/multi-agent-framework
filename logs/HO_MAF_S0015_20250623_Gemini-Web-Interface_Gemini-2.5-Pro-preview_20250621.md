**To:** The next LLM Assistant
**From:** LLM Assistant #15 (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Session S0015)
**Subject:** Handover of the `multi-agent-framework` Project
**Date:** 2025-06-23

**1. Overall Project Goal**
The primary objective of this project is to design and build a resilient, configurable, multi-agent development framework. The core philosophy is to create a system that can mitigate common LLM failure modes (like context drift and regression errors) through explicit configuration files (`agent_workflows.json`, `roomodes.json`) and a robust agent hierarchy.

**2. Current Project Root Path**
`d:\mca_universe\01_frameworks\multi_agent_framework\`

**3. Detailed Current Status of Files and Directories**
This project was formally created during the "Project Mitosis" in session S0015, where it was separated from the original `roo_code_LLM_universe`. The structure has been intentionally organized to separate source-controlled development files from runtime configurations.

* `src/`: Contains the source-controlled versions of the core configuration files.
    * `agent_workflows.json`: Defines the operational logic and agent interaction rules. This is the "source of truth" for development.
    * `roomodes.json`: Contains the JSON definitions for all custom agents. This is the source file for agent prompts and roles.
* `docs/`: Contains high-level design and architectural documentation.
    * `custom_agent_framework.md`: The primary architectural document for the framework.
* `logs/`: Contains project-specific development and progress logs starting from this project's formal creation.
* `.agent_workflows` & `.roomodes`: These files in the root are the **runtime versions** used by external tools like RooCode. They are intentionally ignored by Git and should be generated/updated from the files in `src/`.
* `LICENSE`: The project is licensed under the MIT License.
* `README.md`: Provides a high-level overview of the project's purpose and history.

**4. Summary of Key Decisions Made and Important Actions Taken**
Our session (S0015) was foundational and focused entirely on architectural setup:
* **Project Mitosis:** The most critical action was separating this framework from the monolithic `roo_code_LLM_universe` into its own dedicated, version-controlled project.
* **Runtime vs. Development Separation:** We established a clear architectural pattern where version-controlled source files (in `src/`) are distinct from the runtime configuration files (in the root, ignored by Git).
* **New Logging Strategy:** A new, more granular logging system was implemented. This project now maintains its own logs, prefixed with `MAF-S01`, and includes a global session counter (`S0015`).
* **Standardization:** Utility scripts (`generate_project_manifest.ps1`), a `LICENSE` file, and new naming conventions were added to formalize the project.

**5. Git Activity Summary**
* **Commit `a621d35` (main):** `feat: Initial commit of the multi-agent framework (S0015-MAF-S01-20250622-1)`. This is the root commit, establishing the entire project structure as described above.

**6. The Very Next Immediate Planned Step(s)**
The foundational setup is complete. The next phase is to resume active development of the framework itself. The immediate next step is to **refine the agent definitions and workflows.**
* **Known Issue from Previous Session:** The last development session (S13) concluded upon discovering that relying on `customInstructions` to make an agent police itself is unreliable. The original plan was to address this.
* **Next Action:** The user will likely want to discuss strategies to solve this "self-policing" flaw by enhancing the `Dispatcher`'s logic or the workflow definitions in `agent_workflows.json`.

**7. Pointers to Crucial Documentation/Standard Files**
Your behavior must be governed by the standards defined in the `development_standards` project. Key documents for you to review immediately are:
* `development_standards/standards.md`
* `development_standards/docs/llm_interaction_rules.md`
* `development_standards/docs/llm_handover_procedures.md` (for when you finish your work)
* The `user_profile_for_llm_assistance.md` in the `mca_universe` root.

**8. My Role During Tenure**
My role in this session (S0015) was purely as a **Systems Architect**. I assisted the user in refactoring the old project, defining the new architecture, establishing project standards, and creating the initial repository structure.

**9. Specific Instructions/Context for the New LLM**
* **Adhere to the file structure.** The separation of `src/` from the root is a critical design choice. Do not modify runtime files directly.
* **Follow the new logging and commit procedures.** The user has put significant effort into defining these; they are not optional.
* Be prepared to discuss the core architectural problem of agent "self-policing" as your first major task.
