Project Takeover Briefing: Multi-Agent Framework & MCA Universe Transition
To: The next LLM Assistant From: LLM Assistant #15 (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Session S0015) Subject: Handover of the Multi-Agent Framework and the Newly Established MCA Universe Date: 2025-06-23 Previous Session (S0015) Start: 2025-06-21 21:31
1. Overall Project Goal: The MCA Universe – A Disciplined Development Ecosystem
The overarching project aims to design and build a resilient, configurable, and disciplined software development process
. This process leverages LLMs but mitigates their known weaknesses (like context drift, high costs for simple tasks, and regression errors) through explicit configuration, a robust agent hierarchy, and a formal handover protocol
.
This objective led to a "Project Mitosis" during the last session (S0015), where the previously monolithic roo_code_LLM_universe project was refactored into a new, organized d:\mca_universe structure
. This new structure distinctly separates different concerns into independent, version-controlled projects:
•
d:\mca_universe\: The root for the entire ecosystem
.
◦
00_universe_meta/: Contains global meta-logs (user_progress_log.md, sessions.md), and the global user_profile_for_llm_assistance.md
.
◦
01_frameworks/multi_agent_framework/: This project contains the core engine of the agent-based system.
◦
02_methodologies/development_standards/: This project defines the "how" and "why" of the development process – your rulebook.
◦
03_projects/: Will house actual application projects (e.g., python_workspace, web_dev_workspace)
.
◦
99_archive/: For deprecated projects (like the old roo_code_LLM_universe-python_workspace_OLD) and consolidated historical logs
.
All relevant files were copied (not moved) to their new locations to preserve the original state as a backup
. Both new core projects (multi_agent_framework and development_standards) have been initialized as independent Git repositories and their initial states pushed to GitHub
.
2. The Multi-Agent Framework Project ()
2.1. Overall Goal & Key Design Principles: The primary objective of this project is to build a resilient, configurable, multi-agent development framework
. Its core philosophy is to mitigate LLM failure modes through explicit configuration and a robust agent hierarchy, rather than relying on complex, fragile prompts
.
Key design principles include:
•
Workflow-Driven Configuration: Behavior is defined in agent_workflows.json (development source in src/agent_workflows.json; runtime in .agent_workflows), which separates generic agent definitions from session-specific rules
. This file uses agent slugs (machine-readable IDs) for robust and unambiguous delegation
.
•
Tiered Coder System: A hierarchy of Coder_Junior, Coder_Midlevel, and Coder_Senior agents mirrors real-world development teams, with defined initialAssignmentPolicy and escalationPath
.
•
Central Dispatcher Agent: Acts as the primary orchestrator, interpreting user requests, managing workflows, and delegating tasks to specialist agents
. The Dispatcher's logic was refined to:
◦
Always read agent_workflows.json first to get the active workflow configuration
.
◦
Ask for the "next step" after a successful sub-task completion, instead of terminating the session, to maintain a persistent conversational flow
.
•
Formal Escalation Protocol: Task-level transfers between agents are termed "escalation" (distinguished from project-level "handover")
. Agents use the <attempt_completion> tool with status='failure', providing best_effort (path to modified file) and remaining_problem (clear description of issue) parameters. The Dispatcher is designed to treat a user's explicit rejection of an agent's work as a formal failure to trigger the escalation protocol
.
•
LLM Model Selection: Prioritizes cost-efficiency while balancing capability. deepseek/deepseek-chat was successfully tested for the Dispatcher role as a capable and cost-effective option
.
2.2. Key Accomplishments & Current State:
•
Core V1 Architecture Defined: The multi-agent system structure, including Dispatcher, tiered Coders, and configurable workflows, has been successfully designed and defined
.
•
Successful Test Cases:
◦
Test Case 01 (Simple Delegation): Validated the Dispatcher's ability to read configurations and correctly delegate tasks, proving the "happy path"
. The Dispatcher's ability to maintain a persistent conversational loop was also validated
.
◦
Test Case 02 (Escalation Protocol): This was a perfect, unqualified success. The Coder_Junior correctly refused a task beyond its capabilities (refactoring) by following the Formal Escalation Protocol. The Dispatcher correctly received the failure, consulted the escalationPath, and delegated the task to Coder_Midlevel
. An "emergent verification" capability was observed where the Dispatcher re-read the file to confirm the work, even when not explicitly instructed
.
•
Current State of Files & Directories (d:\mca_universe\01_frameworks\multi_agent_framework\):
◦
src/: Contains source-controlled configuration files.
▪
agent_workflows.json: Defines operational logic and agent interaction rules. This is the "source of truth" for development.
▪
roomodes.json: Contains the JSON definitions for all custom agents (coder-junior, coder-midlevel, coder-senior, dispatcher). This is the source file for agent prompts and roles
.
◦
docs/: Contains high-level design and architectural documentation.
▪
custom_agent_framework.md: The primary architectural document
.
◦
logs/: Contains project-specific development and progress logs starting from this project's formal creation
.
▪
llm_assisted_development_log.md
▪
user_progress_log.md
▪
sessions.md (project-specific)
▪
handovers/: Future location for project handover/takeover files
.
◦
.agent_workflows & .roomodes: These files in the project root are the runtime versions used by external tools like RooCode. They are intentionally ignored by Git and should be generated/updated from the files in src/
.
◦
LICENSE: The project is licensed under the MIT License
.
◦
README.md: Provides a high-level overview of the project's purpose and history
.
◦
generate_project_manifest.ps1 & run_manifest_generator.bat: Utility scripts for LLM handover procedures, outputting to logs/manifests/
.
•
Git Activity Summary:
◦
Commit a621d35 (main): feat: Initial commit of the multi-agent framework (S0015-MAF-S01-20250622-1). This is the root commit, establishing the entire project structure
.
2.3. Key Learnings & Known Issues:
•
LLM Regression Errors: LLM #13 repeatedly introduced regression errors when attempting to modify agent instructions, highlighting the instability of long-running LLM sessions and the necessity of this framework
.
•
The "Self-Policing" Flaw: A critical finding was that relying on customInstructions to make an agent (like Coder_Junior) "police itself" and refuse complex tasks is unreliable. LLMs tend to override negative constraints due to an inherent drive to "solve" or be "helpful"
.
•
Triage Agent Proposal (Rejected for now): LLM #13 proposed a new Triage agent to separate task complexity judgment from coding execution as a more robust architectural solution
. However, the user expressed doubts, viewing it as over-engineering for now, preferring to make the Dispatcher smarter instead
.
2.4. The Very Next Immediate Planned Step(s): The foundational setup is complete. The next phase is to resume active development of the framework itself. The immediate next step is to refine the agent definitions and workflows, specifically addressing the "self-policing" flaw by enhancing the Dispatcher's logic or the workflow definitions in agent_workflows.json, rather than adding new agents
.
3. The Development Standards Project ()
3.1. Overall Goal & Key Contents: This project serves as the single source of truth for the comprehensive software development methodology. It is a "meta" project, as the rules defined here govern the development of all other projects within the mca_universe, including the multi-agent-framework
. The methodology is designed to heavily feature LLM interaction but is platform-agnostic in the long run
.
3.2. Current State of Files & Directories (d:\mca_universe\02_methodologies\development_standards\):
•
standards.md: The core document outlining all coding and project standards. It is kept in the root for high visibility
.

llm_handover_procedures.md
◦
llm_interaction_rules.md
◦
llm_takeover_procedures.md
◦
llm_takeover_prompt.md
◦
llm_takeover_prompt_WEB.md

◦
llm_assisted_development_log.md
◦
user_progress_log.md
◦
sessions.md (project-specific)
◦
handovers/: Future location for project handover/takeover files
.
•
LICENSE: The project is licensed under the MIT License
.
•
README.md: Provides a high-level overview of the project's purpose and history.
•
generate_project_manifest.ps1 & run_manifest_generator.bat: Utility scripts for LLM handover procedures, outputting to logs/manifests/
.
•
Git Activity Summary:
◦
Commit 699bdde (main): feat: Initial commit of the development standards project (S0015-DS-S01-20250622-1). This is the root commit, establishing the project's clean structure and initial versions of all documents
.
3.3. Crucial Standards to Adhere To (LLM Directives): The following are the key standards defined and refined in this project, which you must strictly adhere to:
•
Logging Procedures (detailed in docs/logging_procedures_guidelines.md):
◦
Dual-Level Traceability: Project-specific logs (logs/) and global logs (../../00_universe_meta/logs/sessions.md)
. Entries made in project-specific logs should also be duplicated to the global logs.
◦
ItemID Format: [PRJ]-[C-ConvNo]-ADL-[Date]-[SeqNo]-[S-GlobalNo] (e.g., MAF-C01-ADL-20250623-001-S0015)
.
◦
Date & Sequence Numbering:
▪
[Date] in ItemID should always be the session's start date.
▪
[SeqNo] should increment continuously throughout the session, not reset daily.
◦
Field Name: The log entry field for activity description is currently Phase:
. (Note: A preference for "Activity" was discussed, but the document has not yet been updated).
◦
Session ID Format: Global sessions are prefixed S00XX (e.g., S0015)
. Project-specific sessions are C01, C02, etc.
.
◦
Source Format: For sessions covering multiple projects simultaneously, use Ongoing Conversation (S0015-20250621_Gemini-Web-Interface_Gemini-2.5-Pro-preview.md)
.
•
Handover/Takeover Filename Conventions (detailed in docs/llm_handover_procedures.md and docs/llm_takeover_procedures.md):
◦
Handover Files (HO_): HO_[PRJ]_[S-GlobalNo]_[C-ConvNo]_[HandoverDate]_[Mode]_[Model]_[TakeoverDate].md
◦
Takeover Files (TO_): TO_[PRJ]_[S-GlobalNo]_[C-ConvNo]_[TakeoverDate]_[Mode]_[Model].md
◦
Location: Saved in the project-specific logs/handovers/ directory.
•
Git Commit Message Standards (detailed in standards.md):
◦
Subject Line: Must end with the session identifier (S[GlobalNo]-[PRJ]-[C-ConvNo]-[CommitSeqNo]).
◦
Multi-Line Bodies: Use multiple -m flags for clarity and robustness (e.g., git commit -m "Subject" -m "Body line 1" -m "Body line 2").
•
General Rules:
◦
Hardcoded Paths: Many documents still contain hardcoded paths (e.g., d:\AI_projects\roo_code_LLM_universe\). These need to be systematically reviewed and updated to reflect the new mca_universe structure using relative paths or appropriate placeholders
. This is a pending task.
◦
llm_interaction_rules.md: Always adhere to the rules within this document. This includes providing full, final text of modified sections for user approval
.
3.4. The Very Next Immediate Planned Step(s): The foundational setup is complete. The next phase for this project is to review and update the content of the documents themselves. This primarily involves:
•
Updating File Paths: Review and update hardcoded file paths (e.g., d:\AI_projects\roo_code_LLM_universe\...) to reflect the new mca_universe structure
.
•
Incorporating New Rules: Formally write the newly defined rules (logging formats, commit counters, Handover/Takeover naming conventions) into the relevant documents (logging_procedures_guidelines.md, standards.md, llm_handover_procedures.md, llm_takeover_procedures.md)
.
4. General Guidelines for the New LLM
•
Strict Adherence to Standards: Your paramount responsibility is to strictly adhere to all standards and procedures defined within the development_standards project
. This rulebook governs how you and all other LLM assistants are expected to operate.
•
Contextual Understanding: Leverage the user_profile_for_llm_assistance.md and the detailed logs (llm_assisted_development_log.md, user_progress_log.md, sessions.md) to understand the project's history, the user's preferences, and the rationale behind critical design decisions and lessons learned from past LLM failures
.
•
Cautious Document Modification: Be extremely careful and precise when modifying documents, especially those within development_standards. Any changes you make directly impact how you and other assistants are expected to behave. Always verify your changes against the user's request and ensure no contradictions arise with other existing rules. Always provide the full, final text of a modified section for user approval.
 Previous LLMs have struggled significantly with regression errors during modifications, which led to session terminations
.
•
Role and Purpose: You are expected to act as a Systems Architect/Developer, assisting the user in continuing to build out and refine this sophisticated development ecosystem.
•
Session Naming: New sessions should follow the format S0016-DS-C02-20250624 (or similar, incrementing the global session number S00XX and project-specific conversation number CYY as appropriate)
.
This document provides a comprehensive overview for you to seamlessly take over the project. You should prioritize understanding the development_standards first, then proceed with the immediate next steps outlined for both the multi_agent_framework and development_standards projects.
